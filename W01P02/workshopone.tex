Sketch the region \emph{R} by $1 \le x \le 2$ and $0 \le y \le \frac{1}{x^3}$.

\begin {enumerate}

	\item Find (exactly) the number $\alpha$ such that the line $x = \alpha$ divides \emph{R} into two parts of equal area.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item To split the area found under a curve of a definite integral, define $\alpha$ as some point between the closed interval of [a, b].
		\item Define two integrals between \emph{a} and $\alpha$, and  $\alpha$ and \emph{b} and set them equal to each other (as they are of equal area).
		\item Solve for $\alpha$.
	\end{itemize}
	\begin{equation*}
	\int_1^\alpha \! \frac{1}{x^3} \, \mathrm{d} x = \int_\alpha^2 \! \frac{1}{x^3} \, \mathrm{d} x
	\end{equation*}
	\begin{equation*}
	a = \sqrt{\frac{8}{5}}
	\end{equation*}
	
	\item Then find (to three places) the number \emph{b} such that the line $y = b$ divides \emph{R} into two parts of equal area.
	
	First, find the total area under the curve
	\begin{equation*}
	\int_1^2 \! \frac{1}{x^3} \,\mathrm{d} x = \frac{3}{8} = A
	\end{equation*}
	What we're looking for is what line that creates a rectangle with the x-axis whose area is equal to half this value, so we need only divide by half!
	\begin{equation*}
	\frac{1}{2} A = \frac{3}{16} = 0.1875 = b
	\end{equation*}

\end{enumerate}
